	abstract = {Intensity fluctuations between an ON-state and an OFF-state, also called blinking, are common to all luminescent objects when studied at the level of individuals. We studied blinking of three dyes from a homologous series (Cy3, Cy5, Cy7). The underlying radical anion states were induced by removing oxidants (i.e. oxygen) and by adding the reductant ascorbic acid. We find that for different conditions with distinct levels of oxidants in solution the OFF-state lifetime always increases in the order Cy3{\textless}Cy5{\textless}Cy7. Longer OFF-times are related to higher reduction potentials of the fluorophores, which increase with the size of the chromophore. Interestingly, we find reaction rates of the radical anion that are unexpectedly low at the assumed oxygen concentration. On the other hand, reaction rates meet the expectations of similar Rehm–Weller plots when methylviologen is used as oxidant, confirming the model of photoinduced reduction and oxidation reactions. The relation of OFF-state lifetimes to redox potentials might enable predictions about the nature of dark states, depending on the fluorophores’ nano-environment in super-resolution microscopy.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence is a versatile tool for spectroscopic investigations and imaging of dynamic processes and structures across various scientific disciplines. The photophysical performance, that is, signal stability and signal duration, of the employed fluorophores is a major limiting factor. In this Letter, we propose a general concept to covalently link molecules, which are known for their positive effect in photostabilization, to form a combined photostabilizer with new properties. The direct linkage of two (or more) photostabilizers will allow one to obtain combined or synergetic effects in fluorophore stabilization and can simplify the preparation of imaging buffers that would otherwise require a mixture of photostabilizers for optimal performance. This concept was explored by synthesizing a molecule with a reducing and oxidizing moiety that is referred to as internal ROXS or "iROXS". Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, inter- and intramolecular healing of iROXS was observed, that is, strongly reduced blinking and increased photostability of the cyanine fluorophore Cy5. Moreover, it is shown that a covalently coupled photostabilizer can replace a mixture of molecules needed to make a functional photostabilizing ROXS buffer and might hence represent the new standard for defined and reproducible imaging conditions in single-molecule experiments. In self-healing fluorophores with intramolecular triplet-state quenching, an unprecedented photostability increase of {\textgreater}100-fold was obtained when using iROXS, which is even competitive with solution-based healing. Control experiments show that the oxidizing part of the iROXS molecule, an aromatic nitro group, dominates the healing process. The suggested synthetic concept and the proof-of-concept experiments represent the starting point for the quest to identify optimal combinations of linked photostabilizers for various fluorescence applications.},

	abstract = {Intramolecular photostabilization via triple-state quenching was recently revived as a tool to impart synthetic organic fluorophores with ‘self-healing’ properties. To date, utilization of such fluorophore derivatives is rare due to their elaborate multi-step synthesis. Here we present a general strategy to covalently link a synthetic organic fluorophore simultaneously to a photostabilizer and biomolecular target via unnatural amino acids. The modular approach uses commercially available starting materials and simple chemical transformations. The resulting photostabilizer–dye conjugates are based on rhodamines, carbopyronines and cyanines with excellent photophysical properties, that is, high photostability and minimal signal fluctuations. Their versatile use is demonstrated by single-step labelling of DNA, antibodies and proteins, as well as applications in single-molecule and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. We are convinced that the presented scaffolding strategy and the improved characteristics of the conjugates in applications will trigger the broader use of intramolecular photostabilization and help to emerge this approach as a new gold standard.},

	abstract = {In recent years, optical microscopy techniques have emerged that allow optical imaging at unprecedented resolution beyond the diffraction limit. These techniques exploit photostabilizing buffers to enable photoswitching and/or the enhancement of fluorophore brightness and stability. A major drawback with the use of photostabilizing buffers, however, is that they cannot be used in live cell imaging. In this paper, we tested the performance of self-healing organic fluorophores, which undergo intramolecular photostabilization, in super-resolution microscopy examining both targeted (stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy) and stochastic readout (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)). The overall goal of the study was to identify dyes and conditions that lead to improved spatial and temporal resolution of both techniques without the need for mixtures of photostabilizing agents in the imaging buffer. As a result of previously shown superior performance, we identified an ATTO647N-photostabilizer conjugate as a potential candidate for STED microscopy. We have here characterized the photostability and resulting performance of this nitrophenylalanine (NPA) conjugate of ATTO647N on oligonucleotides in STED microscopy. We found that the superior photophysical performance resulted in optimal STED imaging and demonstrated that single-molecule fluorescent transients of individual fluorophores can be obtained with both the excitation- and STED-laser. In similar experiments, we also tested a nitrophenylacetic acid conjugate of STAR635P, another frequently used dye in STED microscopy, and present a characterization of its photophysical properties. Finally, we performed an analysis of the photoswitching kinetics of self-healing Cy5 dyes (containing trolox, cyclooctatetraene and NPA-based stabilizers) in the presence of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and cysteamine, which are typically used in STORM microscopy. In line with previous work, we found that intramolecular photostabilization strongly influences photoswitching kinetics and requires careful attention when designing STORM-experiments. In summary, this contribution explores the possibilities and limitations of self-healing dyes in super-resolution microscopy of differing modalities.},

With the cost of microscopes dropping and the availability of fully automated microscopes, the volume of microscopy data produced has increased tremendously. These developments have moved the bottleneck of throughput from image acquisition and sample preparation to data analysis. Furthermore, requirements for analysis procedures have become more stringent given the requirement of various journals to make data and analysis procedures available. To address this we have developed a new data analysis package for analysis of fluorescence microscopy data of rod-like cells. Our software ColiCoords structures microscopy data at the single-cell level and implements a coordinate system describing each cell. This allows for the transformation of Cartesian coordinates of both cellular images (e.g. from transmission light or fluorescence microscopy) and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data to cellular coordinates. Using this transformation, many cells can be combined to increase the statistical significance of fluorescence microscopy datasets of any kind. Coli-Coords is open source, implemented in the programming language Python, and is extensively documented. This allows for modifications for specific needs or to inspect and publish data analysis procedures. By providing a format that allows for easy sharing of code and associated data, we intend to promote open and reproducible research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The source code and documentation can be found via the project’s GitHub page.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
